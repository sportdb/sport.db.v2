# DESCRIPTION
# The tokenizer takes a string of source code (the contents of a source code
# file basically) and turns it into tokens. The tokens represent all of the
# smallest individual chunks of a program that can be processed. The valid
# tokens in a programming language are specified by a grammar. We have a grammar
# file in the repository as well. It is grammar.txt. Please keep it open as you
# read tokenizer.py and parser.py.
