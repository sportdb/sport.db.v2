# DESCRIPTION
# This file defines the nodes that the parser can create. Nodes are meaningful
# chunks of a program for the interpreter to interpret. For example, generally
# each statement will become a node.

# For debug purposes, we'll need to know the locations of all Nodes

class Node:
    line_num: int

# All statements in NanoBASIC have a line number identifier
# that the programmer puts in before the statement (*line_id*).
# This is a little confusing because there's also the "physical"
# line number (*line_num*), that actual count of how many lines down
# in the file where the statement occurs.
