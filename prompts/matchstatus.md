## q: hello. football (soccer). can you explain / list all possible match stati e.g. suspended, aborted, etc.?


In football (soccer), match statuses describe the administrative state of a game. These statuses are defined by the International Football Association Board (IFAB) Laws of the Game and specific competition regulations. 


Common Match Statuses

- **Scheduled / Not Started:** The match is planned but hasn't kicked off yet.
- **Live / In Play:** The match is currently active and within its 90-minute (plus stoppage time) duration.
- **Postponed:** The match is rescheduled to a future date before it starts. Common reasons include waterlogged pitches or scheduling conflicts.
- **Suspended:** The match is temporarily paused with the intention of resuming later that same day. This can be due to temporary issues like floodlight failure or lightning.
- **Abandoned:** The match started but was stopped prematurely and will not resume immediately. Unlike a suspension, an abandoned match is usually replayed in its entirety or its outcome is decided by a competition authority.
- **Cancelled:** The match is called off before it starts and will not be rescheduled at all. This is common for friendlies or matches that no longer affect league standings.
- **Forfeited:** One team is declared the loser (usually a 3-0 scoreline) as a penalty for breaking rules, such as fielding an ineligible player or failing to show up.
- **Finished / Done:** The match has reached its natural conclusion, and a result is final. 


Key Distinctions

Status  |	When it occurs |	Intent to resume?
--------:------------------:------------------------
Postponed |	Before kickoff |	Yes, at a future date.
Suspended |	After kickoff  |	Yes, usually the same day.
Abandoned |	After kickoff  |	No, usually replayed or decided by authorities.


## q: what about w/o and o/w  what is a matching "standard" status?  bonus: can you suggest common abbrevations for the match stati?


In football (soccer), w/o is a specific technical status, while o/w usually refers to a type of match result rather than an administrative status.

Status Meanings

- **w/o (Walkover):** This corresponds to the standard status of Awarded or Forfeit. A walkover occurs when a team is awarded a victory (typically 3-0) because the opponent is unable or unwilling to play, or has been disqualified before the match begins.
- **o/w (Other Win):** This is not an official FIFA match status. Instead, it is commonly used in betting markets (specifically "Correct Score" pools) to represent an Other Away Win. It covers any winning scoreline for the away team that isn't explicitly listed on the betting slip, such as 4-2 or 5-1.
