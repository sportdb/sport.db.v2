# Q: can you explain asdet, that is, after sudden death extra time?

**ASDET** stands for **"After Sudden Death Extra Time"**. This term describes a match result where a winner was decided during an extra time period using the **Golden Goal** rule—a system where the first team to score immediately wins the match. 


### Key Concepts of ASDET

**Golden Goal Rule:** Formally introduced by FIFA in **1993**, this rule meant that if a game was tied after 90 minutes, it would enter a 30-minute extra time period. If any goal was scored during this time, the game ended instantly with that team as the winner.

**Historical Context:** The rule was used in major tournaments like the **1996 and 2000 UEFA European Championships** and the **1998 and 2002 FIFA World Cups**.

**Abolition:** FIFA and IFAB abolished the Golden Goal rule in **2004**. Matches that remain tied after 90 minutes now typically use two full 15-minute halves of extra time (AET), regardless of how many goals are scored. 


### ASDET vs. Sudden Death Penalties

While ASDET refers specifically to the extra time period on the field, "sudden death" is still frequently used in modern football during **penalty shootouts**.


Standard Shootout: Teams take five alternating kicks each.

Sudden Death Phase: If the score remains tied after the first five rounds, the shootout continues one round at a time until one team scores and the other misses, ending the game immediately. 

### Current Usage in 2026

In 2026, most professional competitions continue to follow the AET (After Extra Time) format rather than ASDET. However, some specific organizations, such as the NCAA in the United States, reinstated the "sudden victory" format for postseason play as of 2024 and 2025 to ensure definitive results in playoff scenarios.
