## q: football (soccer). do walkover matches have a date?  for example in the FA Cup 1871/72? or in early euro qualifications?


In football, walkover matches technically
**do not have a specific match date** 
because no game was ever played. In historical records, they are usually listed simply as "Walkover" (W/O) or "scratched" to indicate a team withdrew before a fixture occurred. 

However, for competition scheduling and record-keeping, they are often associated with the **main date** or **deadline** of the round they belonged to. 


### 1. FA Cup 1871/72 Examples

In the inaugural FA Cup, several teams progressed without playing. Their "date" is typically recorded as the general date of the round: 

- **Wanderers vs. Harrow Chequers (First Round):** Listed as a walkover for Wanderers because Harrow Chequers "scratched" (withdrew). While other First Round matches were played on 11 November 1871, this walkover has no unique date.

- **Queen's Park vs. Donington School (First Round):** This is a unique case where the teams could not agree on a date. Instead of a walkover, both were originally allowed to progress, but Donington School later withdrew from the Second Round.

- **Wanderers vs. Queen's Park (Semi-final Replay):** After a 0–0 draw on 5 March 1872, Queen's Park could not afford to travel back to London for a replay and withdrew. Wanderers were granted a walkover to the final; this is often associated with the period between the first match and the final (16 March 1872). 


### 2. Early Euro Qualifications

In early European Championships (then called the European Nations' Cup), walkovers were rare but handled similarly by being recorded under the scheduled fixture window. 

- **Forfeits:** If a team was disqualified or withdrew (e.g., for political reasons, such as Spain refusing to play the USSR in 1960), the matches were awarded as 3–0 wins to the opponent.
- **Recording:** Official UEFA records typically list the result as "3–0 (w/o)" and may use the originally scheduled date of the leg as a placeholder in databases to maintain the tournament timeline. 

### How Walkovers are Documented

---------:-----------------------
Date	 | Usually blank or listed as the "Main Date" of the round.

## q: yes, please check spain vs soviet union.

In the case of the Spain vs. Soviet Union quarter-final in the inaugural 1960 European Nations' Cup, the walkover matches did have officially scheduled dates before the tie was cancelled for political reasons. 

Spain's dictator, Francisco Franco, refused to allow the Spanish team to travel to the USSR or to host the Soviet team in Madrid. As a result, UEFA awarded the Soviet Union a walkover victory (recorded as 3–0 for each leg). 

Originally Scheduled Dates (1960) 

The matches were intended to be a two-legged home-and-away series:

Leg        |	Date Scheduled  |	Venue                        |	Status
-----------:--------------------:--------------------------------:------------
First Leg  | 	29 May 1960	    | Central Lenin Stadium, Moscow  |	Cancelled
Second Leg |	9 June 1960     | 	Santiago Bernabéu, Madrid	 | Cancelled

Key Details of the Forfeit
The Decision: The Spanish government officially announced the suspension of the matches on 24 May 1960, just days before the team was set to travel to Moscow.

The Fallout: UEFA rejected Spanish proposals to play at a neutral venue. Spain was disqualified and fined, and the Soviet Union advanced directly to the final tournament in France.
